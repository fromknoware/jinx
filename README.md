## Migrating Migrations

jinx is a side-project I'm developing as a way to rethink database migrations.

jinx is a migration utility built with and for php, configured with JSON and run in command line or browser environments.

Early Features will include:

- define a database schema with a single JSON file
- migration files are generated by comparing a previous schema with the new one
- order of entities will be irrelevant
